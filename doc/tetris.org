#+TITLE: Tetris

* Introduction
Yes, this is yet another Tetris implementation. The main point for me, however,
is not to produce a game experience, but something completely different. This
is my primary goals:

1. Learn to use TDD from scratch in a project.
2. Learn how to properly package a python program.
3. Use my newly crafted Emacs configuration for Python to see if it works well.
4. Learn more on how to plan my work and define user stories.
5. Learn more about Emacs Org mode.
6. Learn Nose.
7. Learn Coverage
8. Have a project to show, if someone wants to see how I write code.

If you find anything in this project useful. Please go ahead and use it freely.
